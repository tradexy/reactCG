original code on AppOriginal.jsx
Other 3 request API to be entered in browser.
App.jsx, AppOjK.jsx, AppOK.jsx
The 3 are similar. Small isse requesting API Key 2 or 3 times. also be good to hide the api key, i.e. show "****" but not important

to run use:
npm run dev

Next task could be to deploy on web.
